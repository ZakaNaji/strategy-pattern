# Strategy Pattern in Java - Text Processing and Discount Calculation

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the Strategy Pattern in Java with two practical examples: text processing and discount calculation. The project incorporates strategies for manipulating text and calculating discounts to showcase the versatility and power of the Strategy Pattern.

## Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is utilized to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. It enables the selection of algorithm behavior at runtime, enhancing flexibility and code maintainability.

## Project Structure

- `TextProcessorStrategy` - Interface for text processing strategies.
- Concrete text strategies like `ReverseTextStrategy`.
- `TextProcessor` - Context class for text processing.
- `Discounter` - Interface for discount strategies, as described in the Baeldung article.
- `Main` - Entry point demonstrating the use of both text processing and discount strategies.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide practical applications of the Strategy Pattern, illustrating its effectiveness in different scenarios â€“ from text processing to financial calculations.

## Usage

Run the `Main` class to see the Strategy Pattern in action with both text processing and discount calculations. Feel free to extend the project with additional strategies.
